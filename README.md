# Entity R-series
Entity is a community based distributor of Roblox vehicle chassis systems for self propelled land vehicles only. Established 2,024, Entity's goal is to have multiple advanced options for many different vehicle types that are highly extensible and configurable. This project accepts forks and will merge with other forks if an improvement is found.

Entity's philosophy is:

Much like an emulator, try to make recreating as much vehicle types as possible work as best as possible.

Make the tuner's life easier.

Focus on realism.

Focus on configurability.

Optimize as much as possible.

Help plugins interconnect.

# Optimal Game Settings
R-series will not try to impose it's own baked in physics into your game, as a result however you are responsible for setting the game gravity to something realistic to prevent suspension crush. More dynamic suspension is sensitive to the extremely high default gravity to so use the following settings.

57.75 Gravity

Set road friction to 2 (the maximum) (ignore other materials like sand and grass.)
