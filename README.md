# Entity R-series
Entity is a community based distributor of Roblox vehicle chassis systems for self propelled land vehicles only. Established 2,024, Entity's goal is to have multiple advanced options for many different vehicle types that are highly extensible and configurable. This project is open to contributions and will merge with other forks if an improvement is found. Entity is a continuation of A-Chassis 6C Version 1.51 and 1.5, 0.50 is forked from an A-Chassis 1.6 prototype build from June 2,023.

Entity's philosophy is:

- Much like an emulator, try to make recreating as much vehicle types as possible work as best as possible.

- Make the tuner's life easier.

- Focus on realism.

- Focus on configurability.

- Optimize as much as possible.

- Help plugins interconnect.

- Respect how the user's avatar is set up by roblox.

# Optimal Game Settings
R-series will not try to impose it's own baked in physics into your game, as a result however you are responsible for setting the game gravity to something realistic to prevent suspension crush. More dynamic suspension is sensitive to the extremely high default gravity to so use the following settings.

57.75 Gravity in the WorkSpace (you will have to compensate the jump settings once you change gravity, for realism set to 0.7m)

Set road friction to 2 (the maximum) (ignore other materials like sand and grass.)
